"""Connection settings and SDK client ownership.

Nothing in this module is ever a field on a ``weave.Object``. Weave publishes
an object's pydantic fields verbatim to the W&B trace server, and its
``should_redact`` helper does not run on that path, so a credential stored as
a field would be uploaded in plaintext. Components hold a connection on a
private attribute instead. ``tests/test_regressions.py`` asserts this.
